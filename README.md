## Diary

- 06-08: Create the repository and review the "git" operations.
- 06-09: Start from earlier contents and try to understand the Day 1 & Day 2 codes.
- 06-10: Day 1 & Day2: Install packages, MySQL server version, and write the backbone of the app. (P.S. some of the functions are deprecated in the newest python. I kept them unchanged, but will change them in future revise.)
- 06-11 - 06-16: Busy with other things. Temporary stop.
- 06-17: Studied and reviewed Markdown grammars and techniques. Updated the README.txt.
- 06-18 - 06-27: Personal business, temprorary stop.
- 06-28: God, I've wasted so much time. Anyway, I'm back, catching up the progress to originally planned Day-4 content. The key information of this day is the use of metaclass, which is quite interesting a characteristic of python.
- 06-29: Day-5, I found another blog which has the newest version of this tutorial at [aodabo's blog.](https://aodabo.tech/blog/). Much thanks to that guy, he fixed many typos and little bugs in the old version, and updated the whole tutorial with async syntax. It is inspring that the web frame construction should be considered from both the bottom-up view and the up-bottom view.
- 06-30: Day-6/Day-7, construct a easy way to read from & write to configs. Learn about MVC (Model-View-Controller).
